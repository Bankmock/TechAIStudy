        <h2>The Power of Compounding: An Example</h2>
        <p>Let's illustrate the impact of compounding:</p>
        <p>Imagine you invest ₹10,000 at an 8% annual interest rate for 20 years.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Simple Interest:** Your money would grow by ₹800 each year ($10,000 \times 0.08 = ₹800$). Over 20 years, you'd earn ₹16,000 in interest ($800 \times 20$), for a total of ₹26,000.</li>
            <li>**Compound Interest (Annual):** The interest earned each year is added to the principal, so the next year's interest is calculated on a larger base.
                <br>Year 1: ₹10,000 * 8% = ₹800. New Principal = ₹10,800
                <br>Year 2: ₹10,800 * 8% = ₹864. New Principal = ₹11,664
                <br>...and so on.
                <br>After 20 years, with annual compounding, your investment would grow to approximately **₹46,609.57**.
            </li>
            <li>**Compound Interest (Monthly):** If compounded monthly, the interest is added even more frequently. The same ₹10,000 at 8% compounded monthly for 20 years would grow to approximately **₹49,006.18**.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, compound interest, especially with higher frequency, leads to significantly greater wealth accumulation over time. This is why it's often called the "8th wonder of the world."</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between simple and compound interest?</div>
            <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods, leading to exponential growth over time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Does more frequent compounding always mean more money?</div>
            <p>Yes, generally. The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., daily vs. annually), the more often the interest gets added to the principal, and thus the faster your money earns "interest on interest." However, the difference might be negligible for very short tenures or very low rates.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I use this calculator for loans (compound interest payable)?</div>
            <p>While the mathematical principle is the same, this calculator is primarily designed to show investment growth (interest earned). For loan EMIs and repayment schedules, our <a href="https://techaistudy.com/finance-tool/loan-emi-calculator/">Loan EMI Calculator</a> would be more appropriate.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is SIP, and how does it relate to this calculator?</div>
            <p>SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan, where you make regular, fixed contributions to an investment (like a mutual fund). Our calculator allows you to factor in these 'Additional Contributions' (monthly or annually) to project the growth of your SIPs along with a lump sum or just on their own.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is my investment data saved or tracked?</div>
            <p>No, your input financial data (principal, rate, tenure, etc.) is processed only in your web browser. We do not store or share any of the information you enter into the calculator, ensuring complete privacy and security.</p>
