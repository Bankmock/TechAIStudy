        <h2>Key Factors Affecting the SBI PO Prelims Cut-Off</h2>
            <p>The following factors have a direct impact on the sectional and overall cut-offs for the SBI PO Prelims:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Difficulty Level of the Exam:</strong> If the exam paper is particularly challenging in a given year, the cut-offs may be lower.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Number of Vacancies:</strong> Fewer available positions often lead to higher cut-offs.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization Process:</strong> SBI normalizes scores to ensure fairness across different shifts if the exam is conducted in multiple sessions.</li>
            </ul>
